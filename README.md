# BOLT: Bendable Optimization and Learning Toolkit

Bolt is the fastest man alive and a cool cartoon dog, but here we bring to you a toolkit to easily run machine learning algorithms. Bolt is a Bend module for machine learning and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

## Installation

### Dependencies
Bolt requires:
- [Bend (>= 0.2.37)](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend)
- HVM (>= 2.0.22)

### User installation

Since bend does not have a package manager yet, clone the repo and you can directly import from bolt directory.

git clone https://github.com/InferBend/Bolt.git
```
